* DONE Lock Poisoning.
	When a thread owning a lock panics, it goes out of scope without unlocking,
	leaving other lock users in a deadlock situation.

* DEL Use Dynamic Dispatch on Container Wrappers Instead of Generics.
* TODO Const Hash Trait:
	Add a user interface for customizing how keys are 
	hashed into buckets for associative container.
* DEL Parallel Associative Container Methods.
	Make methods in associative container parallel.
* DONE Clone for Concurrent Containers.
* DEL Compact IO Map
	Instead of building a map with elements offset based on key hash,
	just pack elements to be more space efficient.
* DONE Prefetcher Trait
* TODO Prefetcher building block implementations.
A building block wrapping another and asynchronously prefetching keys based.
on some predictions.
* DONE Parallel Tests
	Build Concurrent Container trait tests.
* DONE Test Stream building block
* DONE Individual components unit tests.
* DONE Builder pattern to build a cache.
* DONE Reference wrapper to wrap values into references.
	The building block name is "policy" and goes in a different directory
	than wrapper.
* DEL Rename wrapper into transform
* DONE Compresion building block.
* TODO Benchmarks:
+ Multiple distributions of keys
+ Different sizes of keys and values.
* TODO inclusive connector building block.

Insertions go into the last level and shallow copies of what is in the
last level goes in the first level.
* TODO Resizable building blocks.
