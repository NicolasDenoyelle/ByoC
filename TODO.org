* CloneMut Pinnning instead of Boxing
* DONE Lock Poisoning.
	When a thread owning a lock panics, it goes out of scope without unlocking,
	leaving other lock users in a deadlock situation.

* DEL Use Dynamic Dispatch on Container Wrappers Instead of Generics.
* TODO Const Hash Trait:
	Add a user interface for customizing how keys are 
	hashed into buckets for associative container.
* DEL Parallel Associative Container Methods.
	Make methods in associative container parallel.
* DONE Clone for Concurrent Containers.
* DEL Compact IO Map
	Instead of building a map with elements offset based on key hash,
	just pack elements to be more space efficient.
* DONE Prefetcher Trait
* DONE Prefetcher building block implementations.
A building block wrapping another and asynchronously prefetching keys based.
on some predictions.
* DONE Parallel Tests
	Build Concurrent Container trait tests.
* DONE Test Stream building block
* DONE Individual components unit tests.
* DONE Builder pattern to build a cache.
* DONE Reference wrapper to wrap values into references.
	The building block name is "policy" and goes in a different directory
	than wrapper.
* DEL Rename wrapper into transform
* DONE Compression building block.
* DONE Documentation pass
* TODO Benchmarks:
+ Multiple distributions of keys
+ Different sizes of keys and values.
* TODO inclusive connector building block.
Insertions go into the last level and shallow copies of what is in the
last level goes in the first level.
* DEL Resizable building blocks.
* TODO [Capacity / Pop / Push] based on size and not number.
* TODO Distributed building block
* TODO Front-ends
For instance:
+ The Memory is partitionned with only 50% to the user. On user page fault event,
user pages are written to the cache;
+ A POSIX buffered filesystem implementation where reads and writes go to
the cache;
* DEL async Get and GetMut
Because there might be delay fetching far data.
* DONE Get trait with LifetimeGuard wrapper in the return type.
* TODO Batch builder implementation.
