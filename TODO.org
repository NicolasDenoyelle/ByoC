* CloneMut Pinnning instead of Boxing
* DONE Lock Poisoning.
	When a thread owning a lock panics, it goes out of scope without unlocking,
	leaving other lock users in a deadlock situation.

Can't do. Associated type need to have the same generics for all implementations of
the trait. Here two implementations may have different generics so we can't have
generics in the associated type. Then if generic are attached to the trait impl
instead, we have the problem of having unconstrained type parameters when the type
built has different generics than the type built from.
